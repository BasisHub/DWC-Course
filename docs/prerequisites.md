# Prerequisites - READ FIRST!

This page lists the prerequisites for the BBj DWC Training course. It also contains several links to free online courses that cover the basics for HTML, CSS, and even responsive layouts using CSS.

## DWC Training Class Prerequisites

Students should be familiar with the following concepts before beginning the DWC training course. If you're new to BBj, the **[BBj Beginner Course](https://basishub.github.io/BBj-Beginner-Course/)** covers all of these foundational topics:

### BASIS Product Development in BDT

- The Eclipse IDE and the BDT Plugins
- Editing Code in BDT's BBj CodeEditor

### Introduction to the BBx Language

- Objects in BBj
- BBj Objects and Controls
- Writing Graphical User Interface (GUI) programs
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Callbacks and BBjEvent Objects
- Callbacks vs. ReadRecords

More specifically, students should be comfortable editing and running GUI and BUI programs in the Eclipse IDE using the BDT code editor. Additionally, students should be familiar with BBj's object-oriented syntax and the process_events/callback event paradigm.

## Online Courses

Students with a basic understanding of HTML and CSS will be able to get significantly more out of the advanced session, as the course devotes its time to using HTML and CSS in conjunction with the Dynamic Web Client. For those without a web background, BASIS recommends taking advantage of free online resources for learning HTML and CSS.

While it's not necessary to fully understand CSS Grid and Flexbox, those concepts will be covered in the advanced course section that deals with flow layout and responsive design.

### Recommended Free Courses

- **[FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/)** - Covers everything you need to know and then some. Complete the Basic HTML and HTML5 course, then complete the Basic CSS course. The Responsive Web Design Principles course, CSS Flexbox course, and CSS Grid course introduce layout concepts.

- **[Khan Academy's Intro to HTML/CSS](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css)**

- **[Codecademy's Learn HTML](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html)** and **[Learn CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css)**

There are many other free and paid training courses available. As long as you are comfortable with writing and debugging HTML and CSS, you should be able to take full advantage of the topics in the training class and apply them to your GUI programs running in the DWC.
