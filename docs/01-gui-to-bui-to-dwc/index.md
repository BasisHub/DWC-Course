# GUI to BUI to DWC

This chapter covers the fundamentals of transitioning from BBj GUI applications to Browser User Interface (BUI) and the Dynamic Web Client (DWC).

## Concepts Covered in This Chapter

- Registering and launching BBj GUI apps in the BUI and DWC clients using Eclipse and Enterprise Manager
- Using the `INFO(3,6)` to identify the client
- Using BBjSysGui constants with the BBj message box
- Specifying custom DWC modes with the BBj message box
- Running a complete graphical BBj app in the thin client (GUI), the Browser User Interface (BUI), and the Dynamic Web Client (DWC)
- Changing the window to use flow layout, ignoring the x, y, width, and height parameters, and then applying a CSS Grid layout strategy
- Setting attributes on a BBjButton to affect its size and appearance
- Making your app look and act like a real web app instead of a desktop app running in the browser
- Handling runtime errors in the browser's Developer Tools console
