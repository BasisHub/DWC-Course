# Introduction to the Browser's Developer Tools

## Overview

This section starts with an introduction to the browser's Developer Tools, a powerful suite of tools aimed at web developers that are provided by every modern web browser.

## Section Files

We'll be using the `DWC1.bbj` file during this section of the course.

## Concepts Covered in This Section

- Accessing the browser's Developer Tools
- A brief tour of the Developer Tools and their major features
- Modifying the text and style of a BBjControl in the Developer Tools

## Developer Tools Features

The browser's Developer Tools are designed to help web developers with any imaginable web-related task, and since we're now running BBj graphical applications in a web browser, we officially qualify as web developers!

Even if you've never used the browser's Developer Tools before, after these exercises you'll be able to inspect and edit a BUI or DWC app's Document Object Model (DOM) as well as the DIVs that comprise every BBjControl.

The tools help us with:

- **Editing DOM elements** - Access BBjControls directly in the Elements/Inspector tab by modifying HTML, text, class names, attributes, inline styles, etc.
- **Console access** - View messages & errors, debug programs, and execute JavaScript
- **CSS styles viewing** - See all CSS styles associated with an element from all sources, and which styles were chosen vs. ignored
- **Source viewing** - Access cookies, local/session storage, images, scripts, and stylesheets with pretty-print for minified sources
- **Performance profiling** - Profile network and memory performance, including bandwidth throttling to simulate slower networks
- **Device simulation** - Simulate responsive and mobile devices for testing CSS layouts

## Example 1 - Opening the Browser's Developer Tools

### Step 1: Run the Program

Load the `DWC1.bbj` program from the first chapter and run it in the DWC. If the program runs inside a browser window in Eclipse, reconfigure Eclipse to use your default system browser.

### Step 2: Open Developer Tools

Open the browser's Developer Tools using one of these methods:

| Method | Instructions |
|--------|-------------|
| **Context Menu** | Right-click on the page and choose 'Inspect' (Chrome, Edge, Firefox) or 'Inspect Element' (Safari) |
| **Menu Bar** | Chrome: View > Developer > Developer Tools<br/>Edge: Tools > Developer > Developer Tools<br/>Firefox: Tools > Browser Tools > Web Developer Tools<br/>Safari: Develop > Show Web Inspector |
| **Keyboard** | Windows: `F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I`<br/>macOS: `⌘ + ⌥ + I` |

:::tip
The context menu option has the added benefit of selecting the Elements tab and highlighting the code for the element you clicked.
:::

### Step 3: Configure Developer Tools

The Developer Tools offer configuration options including:
- **Dock location** - Display horizontally below, vertically left/right, or in a separate window
- **Light/dark mode** - Choose your preferred theme
- **Color format** - Set default color format

### Step 4: Key Sections to Know

| Tab | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| **Elements** | Displays the DOM (underlying HTML) that makes up the DWC app |
| **Console** | Displays output, messages, warnings, errors, and allows JavaScript execution |
| **Application** | Shows cookies, local/session storage, images, scripts, stylesheets |
| **Styles** | Shows all styles for the selected element; Computed styles shows only rules in effect |

## Example 2 - Modifying a DWC App in the Developer Tools

### Step 1: Find and Modify the Title Bar

Find the element associated with the BBj app's title bar text:

1. Click the element selection tool at the top left of Developer Tools, then click the title bar
2. Search for "dwc-frame-titlebar-text" using `Ctrl+F` (Windows) or `⌘+F` (macOS)
3. Expand disclosure triangles in the Elements tab until you find the DIV

Change the text by either:
- Right-clicking and choosing "Edit Text"
- Double-clicking the text to enter edit mode

### Step 2: Change Title Color

1. Select the correct DOM element
2. Go to the Styles tab
3. Find the "dwc-frame-titlebar-text" class definition
4. Click the closing curly brace `}` and type `color: green`

After adding the color style:

:::note
Changes made in Developer Tools are temporary and will disappear on page refresh. This is perfect for quick testing before making permanent changes in your code.
:::

### Step 3: Enable/Disable Styles

Mouse over styles in the Styles tab to see checkboxes. Uncheck to temporarily disable a style.

### Step 4: Use CSS Custom Properties

Change the color value to a DWC CSS custom property:

```css
color: var(--dwc-color-danger)
```

After typing `var(`, you'll see code completion with all DWC CSS variables including color swatches.

## Example 3 - Setting CSS Styles on Controls

### Step 1: Set Color in Code

Set the text color to green on a label:

```bbj
st!.setStyle("color", "green")
```

### Step 2: Use CSS Custom Properties

Use the DWC's CSS custom property for the "info" theme (purple):

```bbj
st!.setStyle("color", "var(--dwc-color-info)")
```

## Going the Extra Mile

### Change Background Color

Set the background to a light yellow using the warning theme at 90% lightness:

```bbj
st!.setStyle("background", "var(--dwc-color-warning-90)")
```

The `-90` ending indicates 90% lightness (0% = black, 100% = white).

### Button Background Considerations

When changing a BBjButton's background, use `background` not `background-color`:

```bbj
btn!.setAttribute("expanse","xl")
REM btn!.setAttribute("theme","success")
btn!.setStyle("color", "var(--dwc-color-info)")
btn!.setStyle("background", "var(--dwc-color-warning-90)")
```

:::info Why use "background" instead of "background-color"?
The `background` property is a CSS shorthand that combines eight constituent properties (attachment, clipping, color, image, origin, position, repeatability, and size). Using `background-color` only affects the color, which may not override other background properties.
:::

### Complex Background Example

```bbj
logo$ = "'https://basis.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/logo_basis_v2.svg'"
texture$ = "'https://public.basis.cloud/Training/images/lightSwirls.jpg'"
value$ = "url(" + logo$ + ") left 1em bottom 0.5em/auto 25% no-repeat, url(" + texture$ + ") left top/150px repeat"
wnd!.setStyle("background", value$)
```

This sets two backgrounds: the BASIS logo on the bottom left and a swirly pattern covering the entire window.

## More Information About the Browser's Developer Tools

### Style Specificity

When selecting an element, the Styles section shows:

1. **element.style** - Inline styles affecting only that element (highest specificity)
2. **Class styles** - Styles applying to all elements with that class
3. **Universal styles (*)** - Styles applying to all elements

Crossed-out declarations indicate they've been overridden by higher-specificity rules.

See the [Mozilla documentation on specificity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity) for more information.

### CSS Grid Visualization

Clicking on a panel element in the Elements tab overlays a grid showing:
- **Green** - Padding
- **Purple** - CSS Grid gaps
- **Blue** - CSS Grid cells containing BBj controls

![DWC Panel Grid](/img/DwcPanel.png)

Click the small grid tag next to elements with CSS Grid to see sizing information. The Layout tab provides additional grid overlay controls.
