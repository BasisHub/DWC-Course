- Redesigned homepage (Hero + Features + Cards + CTA), restructured sidebar into 4 logical groups, and shifted to professional blue palette with verified dark mode
- Audited all 12 chapters with 6-dimension rubric, producing tier-ranked improvement priorities and actionable v2 content roadmap
- Cross-phase integration verified: 15 connections, 4 E2E flows, zero gaps

**Stats:**
- 234 files created/modified
- 41,555 lines added (TypeScript, CSS, Markdown, planning docs)
- 4 phases, 11 plans
- 10 days from start to ship (2026-01-21 to 2026-01-31)

**Git range:** `feat(01-01)` → `docs(04)`

**What's next:** v2 content depth — address systemic code example gaps (2.7/5.0), expand thin chapters, add Mermaid diagrams to 8 chapters, guided by content audit tier ranking
