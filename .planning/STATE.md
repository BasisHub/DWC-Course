## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 4 phases derived from 18 v1 requirements -- Pre-Flight, Search & Visual Tooling, Nav & Design Polish, Content Audit
- [Roadmap]: Search (SRCH) and Visual (VIS) requirements grouped into one phase -- both are plugin/config-level tooling enablement
- [Roadmap]: Navigation (NAV) and Design (DES) requirements grouped into one phase -- both target the visual/navigational experience

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research flagged React 19 + `future.v4` compatibility as a risk for plugin integration -- Phase 1 must resolve before Phase 2 plugins
- Algolia DocSearch free program may reject commercial training content -- Phase 2 needs fallback plan (local search plugin)
