<objective>
Verify the complete Phase 3 implementation across browsers, viewport sizes, and color modes. This is the visual/functional acceptance gate.

Purpose: Requirements NAV-02, NAV-03, DES-03 require responsive behavior, cross-browser compatibility, and dark mode correctness. These cannot be verified by build or typecheck alone.
Output: Human confirmation that the site looks polished and functions correctly, or a list of issues to address.

  <name>Task 1: Start dev server and run automated checks</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
Run `npm run build` to confirm the full site builds without errors.
Run `npm run typecheck` to confirm no TypeScript issues.
Start the dev server with `npm start` (run in background) so the user can inspect the site.

Print a summary of what was built:
- Sidebar: 4 sections, X chapters total
- Homepage: Hero + Features + Cards + CTA
- Color: Blue palette (light #2563eb, dark #60a5fa)
- Components: Hero (new), ChapterCards (redesigned), HomepageFeatures (redesigned)
  </action>
  <verify>Build and typecheck both pass. Dev server starts on localhost:3000.</verify>
  <done>Site builds cleanly and dev server is running for visual inspection.</done>

  <what-built>
Complete Phase 3 implementation: sidebar restructured into 4 sections, homepage redesigned with hero + feature highlights + grouped chapter cards + closing CTA, color palette shifted from green to blue, dark mode and responsive behavior implemented.
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
Visit http://localhost:3000 and check the following:

**Sidebar (NAV-01):**
1. Sidebar shows 4 collapsible sections: Getting Started, Core Concepts, Advanced Topics, Deployment
2. Getting Started is expanded by default
3. Click each section to expand/collapse -- all 12 chapters appear
4. Top-level pages (Prerequisites, Samples, Resources) appear above sections

**Homepage (DES-01, DES-02):**
5. Hero section: bold title, subtitle, blue "Start Learning" button
6. Feature highlights: 3 text-only cards below hero
7. Chapter cards: 4 section groups with section headings
8. Cards have blue hover border effect
9. Closing CTA at bottom links to Chapter 1
10. Clean, minimal feel with good whitespace (Stripe/Linear tone)

**Dark Mode (DES-03):**
11. Toggle dark mode (use the sun/moon button in navbar)
12. Hero, features, cards all render with appropriate dark colors
13. Blue accent is lighter/brighter in dark mode
14. Card borders and shadows adapt
15. Mermaid diagram (Chapter 1) renders with dark theme
16. Search UI: press Cmd+K, verify highlight color is blue

**Responsive (NAV-02, NAV-03):**
17. Resize browser below 996px width
18. Chapter cards reflow to single column
19. Hero text scales down appropriately
20. Feature highlights stack vertically

**Links:**
21. Click "Start Learning" -- goes to Chapter 1
22. Click any chapter card -- navigates to correct chapter
23. Click "Begin Chapter 1" closing CTA -- goes to Chapter 1
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if everything looks good, or describe any issues that need fixing.</resume-signal>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. Build and typecheck pass
2. Human approves visual/functional quality across all checkpoints
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Human confirms all 23 verification items pass
- No visual regressions in dark mode or responsive layout
- Site is polished enough to show prospects and clients
</success_criteria>
