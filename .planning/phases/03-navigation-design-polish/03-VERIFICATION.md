### Anti-Patterns Found

Systematic scan of modified files for stubs, TODOs, placeholder patterns:

| File | Line | Pattern | Severity | Impact |
|------|------|---------|----------|--------|
| — | — | — | — | No anti-patterns found |

**Findings:**
- No TODO/FIXME comments in any component
- No console.log-only implementations
- No placeholder content
- No empty return statements
- All exports are substantive

### Human Verification Checkpoint

Plan 03-03 was a human verification checkpoint. From 03-03-SUMMARY.md:

- All 23 verification items approved (sidebar, homepage, dark mode, responsive, links)
- User provided explicit "approved" signal
- Duration: ~1 minute
- No issues reported

Human verification covered:
- Sidebar: 4 collapsible sections, default collapsed states, all 12 chapters visible
- Homepage: Hero section, feature highlights, chapter cards, closing CTA
- Dark mode: Toggle functionality, component adaptation, Mermaid diagrams, search UI
- Responsive: Below 996px reflow, text scaling, single-column layout
- Links: All CTA buttons navigate to Chapter 1, chapter cards link correctly

## Build & Type Safety

```bash
$ npm run typecheck
✓ No TypeScript errors

$ npm run build
✓ Build succeeded
✓ Static files generated in "build/"
```

Both automated checks pass cleanly.

## Gaps Summary

**No gaps found.**

All 9 observable truths are verified. All 9 required artifacts exist, are substantive, and are wired. All 7 key links function. All 6 Phase 3 requirements are satisfied. Build and typecheck pass. Human verification completed and approved.

---

**Recommendation:** Phase 3 COMPLETE. Goal achieved — site is polished enough to show prospects and clients with intuitive navigation for learners and consultants. Ready to proceed to Phase 4 (Content Audit).
