# Phase 3 Plan 1: Foundation Summary

**Manual sidebar with 4 collapsible chapter groups, green-to-blue color shift using Tailwind Blue scale, and 5 template leftover files removed**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 2 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-31T10:06:40Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-31T10:08:33Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 2 modified, 5 deleted

## Accomplishments

- Sidebar restructured from flat auto-generated list into 4 logical collapsible sections with Getting Started expanded by default
- Color palette shifted from green (#2e8555/#25c2a0) to professional blue (#2563eb/#60a5fa) with full WCAG-AA compliance
- Five Docusaurus starter template leftover files deleted (2 in src/pages/, 3 SVGs in static/img/)

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Restructure sidebar into 4 grouped sections** - `6166a3f` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Shift color palette from green to blue** - `c9b6d74` (style)
3. **Task 3: Delete template leftover files** - `deca671` (chore)

## Files Created/Modified

- `sidebars.ts` - Manual sidebar with 4 category groups containing autogenerated items per chapter directory
- `src/css/custom.css` - Blue color palette (7 shades each for light and dark modes)
- `src/pages/index.module.css` - DELETED (unused template CSS module)
- `src/pages/markdown-page.md` - DELETED (template demo page)
- `static/img/undraw_docusaurus_mountain.svg` - DELETED (unused template illustration)
- `static/img/undraw_docusaurus_react.svg` - DELETED (unused template illustration)
- `static/img/undraw_docusaurus_tree.svg` - DELETED (unused template illustration)

## Decisions Made

- NAV-01: Chapter grouping follows the CONTEXT.md specification -- chapters 1-3 (Getting Started), 4-6 (Core Concepts), 7-11 (Advanced Topics), 12 (Deployment)
- DES-02: Blue palette uses Tailwind Blue scale as reference -- Blue 600 (#2563eb) for light mode primary (~4.6:1 contrast vs white), Blue 400 (#60a5fa) for dark mode primary (~5.5:1 contrast vs #1b1b1d)
- External link icon CSS rules left untouched -- they use hardcoded SVG fill colors and are independent of the accent color

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Sidebar structure is in place for homepage redesign (Plan 02) to mirror section grouping in chapter cards
- Blue palette is active and will automatically propagate to all components using `var(--ifm-color-primary)`
- Search plugin highlight color automatically picks up the new blue via Infima CSS variable inheritance
- Template cleanup complete -- no dead files to confuse future component work
