<objective>
Audit the Important-tier chapters (Ch03, Ch04, Ch05) and the remaining Critical-tier chapter (Ch06) against the 6-dimension rubric. These chapters bridge foundations and advanced topics.

Purpose: Ch06 (dep:4) is Critical tier and bridges layout concepts to all advanced chapters. Ch03 (dep:2), Ch04 (dep:1), Ch05 (dep:3) are Important tier -- they teach debugging, migration, and control customization that unlock advanced DWC work. Several have notable structural issues: Ch04 and Ch05 have zero code blocks, Ch03 has zero images.
Output: Four per-chapter audit files in `.planning/phases/04-content-audit/chapters/`

Read Chapter 03 (1 file):
- docs/03-dwc-debugging/index.md (116 lines, 0 images, 6 code blocks)

Read Chapter 04 (3 files):
- docs/04-upgrading-apps/index.md
- docs/04-upgrading-apps/01-arc-files.md
- docs/04-upgrading-apps/02-upgrading-grids.md (148 lines total, 3 images, 0 code blocks)

For each chapter, score against the 6-dimension rubric using anchors from 04-RESEARCH.md. Follow the same format as Plan 01 (rubric table + prose + gaps + recommendations + Mermaid).

**Chapter 03 specific concerns:**
- Zero images for a debugging chapter -- visual walkthroughs (DevTools screenshots, console output) would add significant value
- Only 116 lines in a single file -- is this enough for a complete debugging guide?
- RESEARCH recommends: Sequence diagram for browser DevTools debugging flow

**Chapter 04 specific concerns:**
- Zero code blocks for a chapter about upgrading grids -- this is a major gap
- 3 images but no inline code means learners must rely on external sample files
- RESEARCH recommends: Flowchart for migration decision tree (BBjStandardGrid -> BBjGridExWidget)
- Evaluate whether the chapter adequately covers the "why" of migration, not just the "how"
  </action>
  <verify>
Both files exist in `.planning/phases/04-content-audit/chapters/`. Each contains:
- Rubric table with all 6 dimensions scored 1-5
- "Overall: X.X / 5.0" line
- Content Gaps section flagging zero-image issue (Ch03) and zero-code-block issue (Ch04)
- Recommendations referencing available tooling
- Mermaid Diagram Opportunities section
  </verify>
  <done>Chapters 03 and 04 audit files are complete with rubric scores, identified structural gaps (missing images, missing code blocks), actionable recommendations, and Mermaid diagram suggestions.</done>

Read Chapter 05 (1 file):
- docs/05-dwc-controls/index.md (112 lines, 8 images, 0 code blocks)

Read Chapter 06 (1 file):
- docs/06-flow-layouts/index.md (173 lines, 10 images, 12 code blocks)

For each chapter, score against the 6-dimension rubric using anchors from 04-RESEARCH.md. Follow the same format.

**Chapter 05 specific concerns:**
- Zero code blocks but 8 images -- RESEARCH flagged this as relying entirely on images for showing code, which is bad for accessibility and searchability
- This is an Important-tier chapter (dep:3) teaching controls that Ch07, Ch08, Ch10 build on
- Evaluate whether setAttribute usage is adequately explained for readers who will need it in later chapters
- RESEARCH recommends: Class diagram for BBjControl hierarchy / Shadow DOM component structure

**Chapter 06 specific concerns:**
- This is a CRITICAL-tier chapter (dep:4) -- layout concepts used by Ch08, Ch09, Ch10, Ch11
- 173 lines with 10 images and 12 code blocks -- check if the code-to-explanation ratio is right
- Covers both CSS Grid and Flexbox -- evaluate whether both are adequately covered or if one dominates
- RESEARCH recommends: Block diagrams showing Flexbox vs Grid mental models
- As a Critical-tier chapter, this gets full detailed analysis regardless of scores

Both files exist in `.planning/phases/04-content-audit/chapters/`. Each contains:
- Rubric table with all 6 dimensions scored 1-5
- "Overall: X.X / 5.0" line
- Ch05: flags zero-code-block + image-only code presentation issue
- Ch06: full detailed analysis (Critical tier)
- Both: Content Gaps, Recommendations, Mermaid Diagram Opportunities
  </verify>
  <done>Chapters 05 and 06 audit files are complete. Ch05 flags the accessibility concern of image-only code. Ch06 receives Critical-tier full analysis with layout coverage evaluation.</done>

After both tasks complete:
1. All 4 audit files exist in `.planning/phases/04-content-audit/chapters/`
2. Scores are differentiated and anchored to RESEARCH definitions
3. Ch04 and Ch05 zero-code-block issues are prominently flagged
4. Ch03 zero-image issue is flagged
5. Ch06 has full detailed analysis as Critical tier
6. All files follow the same format established by Plan 01
7. Recommendations reference available tooling only
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- ch03-audit.md, ch04-audit.md, ch05-audit.md, ch06-audit.md exist with complete rubric evaluations
- Structural deficits (missing code, missing images) are clearly identified
- Code Examples Quality scores reflect the zero-code-block reality in Ch04 and Ch05
- Ch06 receives thorough treatment befitting its Critical tier status
- i18n assessment is concrete per chapter
- Recommendations are actionable with available tooling
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/04-content-audit/04-02-SUMMARY.md`
