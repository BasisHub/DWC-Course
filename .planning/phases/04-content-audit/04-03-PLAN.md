<objective>
Audit the six Nice-to-have tier chapters (Ch07-12) against the 6-dimension rubric. These are self-contained advanced topics and deployment guidance.

Purpose: These chapters are independent (dependency count 0-1) but complete the curriculum. Several have structural issues: Ch10 has zero images for a visual-embedding chapter, Ch07/08/09 are compact single-file chapters. Chapters scoring 4+ on all dimensions get brief confirmations; lower scores get full analysis.
Output: Six per-chapter audit files in `.planning/phases/04-content-audit/chapters/`

Read Chapter 07 (1 file):
- docs/07-icon-pools/index.md (98 lines, 8 images, 10 code blocks)

Read Chapter 08 (1 file):
- docs/08-control-validation/index.md (132 lines, 11 images, 10 code blocks)

Read Chapter 09 (1 file):
- docs/09-browser-constraints/index.md (95 lines, 2 images, 10 code blocks)

For each chapter, score against the 6-dimension rubric using anchors from 04-RESEARCH.md.

**Brevity rule:** If ALL 6 dimensions score 4+, produce brief confirmation (rubric table + 1-2 sentences + any minor recommendations). If ANY dimension scores 3 or below, produce full detailed analysis.

**Chapter-specific notes:**
- Ch07: Icon Pools -- compact but focused. Check if icon syntax and pool registration are adequately explained for reuse.
- Ch08: Control Validation -- 11 images is the most of any chapter. RESEARCH recommends state diagram for validation states (pristine -> valid/invalid -> custom validity). Check if the validation lifecycle is clear.
- Ch09: Browser Constraints -- only 95 lines for a chapter covering file I/O, printing, clipboard. RESEARCH recommends sequence diagram for file upload/download flow. This chapter may be too thin.

Read Chapter 12 (1 file):
- docs/12-deployment/index.md (152 lines, 1 image, 10 code blocks)

For each chapter, score against the 6-dimension rubric using anchors from 04-RESEARCH.md.

**Apply same brevity rule:** 4+ all dimensions = brief; any 3 or below = full analysis.

**Chapter-specific notes:**
- Ch10: Embedding 3rd Party Components -- zero images for a chapter about embedding charts, maps, and visual components. RESEARCH recommends sequence diagram for BBj <-> embedded JS component event communication. The gap between zero visuals and a visual-components topic is stark.
- Ch11: Advanced Responsive Design -- the second-largest after Ch02 at 315 lines with 3 files and 26 code blocks. Check if media queries and transitions are well-integrated or feel like two separate mini-chapters.
- Ch12: Deployment Options -- final chapter, capstone. RESEARCH recommends flowchart for deployment option decision tree. Check if all deployment paths (standard URL, embedded, PWA) are adequately covered.

After both tasks complete:
1. All 6 audit files exist in `.planning/phases/04-content-audit/chapters/`
2. Scores are differentiated and use RESEARCH anchors consistently
3. Brevity rule applied: chapters with all 4+ scores get brief treatment
4. Ch10 zero-image issue flagged prominently
5. Format is consistent with Plans 01 and 02
6. Combined with Plans 01 and 02, all 12 chapters are now audited
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- ch07 through ch12 audit files exist with complete rubric evaluations
- Analysis depth is proportional to findings (brief for strong chapters, detailed for weak ones)
- All chapters have at least a rubric table, overall score, and any applicable recommendations
- Zero-image/zero-code issues flagged where they exist
- Mermaid diagram opportunities identified where RESEARCH recommended them
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/04-content-audit/04-03-SUMMARY.md`
