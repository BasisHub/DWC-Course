<objective>
Produce the summary rollup document that aggregates all 12 chapter audits into a developer-focused prioritization guide for v2 content work.

Purpose: This is the deliverable that makes the audit actionable. It transforms 12 individual assessments into a clear "what to fix first and why" guide. The tier ranking, cross-chapter patterns, and top recommendations together form the content roadmap input for v2.
Output: `.planning/phases/04-content-audit/04-SUMMARY.md`

  <name>Task 1: Aggregate scores and produce tier ranking</name>

  </files>
  <action>
Read all 12 chapter audit files from `.planning/phases/04-content-audit/chapters/`.

Create `04-SUMMARY.md` with the following sections:

**1. Tier Ranking Table**
Assign final tiers using the formula: Priority = (importance to learner progression via dependency count) x (room for improvement via overall score). Use the RESEARCH dependency graph for importance and audit scores for room for improvement.

Tiers:
- **Critical** (fix first in v2): High dependency count AND scores below 4.0 overall
- **Important** (fix second in v2): Medium dependency count OR critical chapters scoring well (less room for improvement)
- **Nice-to-have** (fix third in v2): Low dependency count, self-contained topics

Format:
```
| Tier | Chapter | Overall Score | Dep Count | Key Issue |
```

**2. Dimension Averages Table**
Average each dimension across all 12 chapters. This reveals systemic patterns (e.g., if code examples quality averages 2.5 across the board, that's a systemic issue, not a per-chapter one).

Format:
```
| Dimension | Average | Range (Low-High) | Systemic? |
```

**3. Cross-Chapter Patterns**
Identify recurring issues that appear in 3+ chapters. Examples might include:
- Chapters relying on images instead of inline code
- Missing prerequisite links between chapters
- Inconsistent use of code annotations
- i18n barriers appearing across multiple chapters

**4. Top 10 Recommendations**
Rank the highest-impact improvements across all chapters. Each recommendation should specify:
- What to do
- Which chapter(s) it affects
- What tooling to use (Mermaid, code tabs, IdealImage, etc.)
- Estimated impact (high/medium/low)

Include both additive and subtractive recommendations in the top 10.

**5. Mermaid Diagram Summary**
Consolidate all Mermaid diagram recommendations from per-chapter audits into a single table:
```
| Chapter | Diagram Type | What It Visualizes | Priority |
```

The summary is developer-focused: no executive summary, no fluff. Tier ranking table + data + actionable items.

File exists at `.planning/phases/04-content-audit/04-SUMMARY.md`. Contains:
- Tier ranking table with all 12 chapters assigned to a tier
- Dimension averages table with all 6 dimensions
- Cross-chapter patterns section with 3+ identified patterns
- Top 10 recommendations list
- Mermaid diagram summary table
- No "executive summary" or filler prose
  </verify>
  <done>Summary rollup is complete with tier ranking, dimension averages, cross-chapter patterns, top 10 recommendations, and Mermaid diagram summary. The content audit phase deliverable is ready for v2 planning.</done>

After task completes:
1. `04-SUMMARY.md` exists and is comprehensive
2. All 12 chapters appear in the tier ranking
3. Tier assignments are consistent with RESEARCH dependency graph AND audit scores
4. Dimension averages are mathematically correct
5. Cross-chapter patterns reference specific chapters, not vague generalizations
6. Top 10 recommendations are specific and actionable
7. No recommendations require tooling not already installed
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- 04-SUMMARY.md exists as the single rollup deliverable
- Every chapter is ranked by priority tier
- Systemic issues are identified through dimension averaging
- Recommendations are ranked and reference available tooling
- The document can be handed to someone starting v2 content work and they know exactly what to do first
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/04-content-audit/04-04-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
