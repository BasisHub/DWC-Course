<objective>
Audit the two Critical-tier foundation chapters (Ch01 and Ch02) against the 6-dimension rubric. These are the largest and most depended-upon chapters in the curriculum.

Purpose: Ch01 (496 lines, 4 files, dep:11) and Ch02 (828 lines, 5 files, dep:10) are the foundation for everything else in the course. Their quality directly impacts every subsequent chapter. Auditing them first establishes the scoring baseline.
Output: Two per-chapter audit files in `.planning/phases/04-content-audit/chapters/`

  <name>Task 1: Audit Chapter 01 - GUI to BUI to DWC</name>
  <files>
    .planning/phases/04-content-audit/chapters/ch01-audit.md
  </files>
  <action>
Read all 4 files in Chapter 01:
- docs/01-gui-to-bui-to-dwc/index.md
- docs/01-gui-to-bui-to-dwc/01-registering-launching.md
- docs/01-gui-to-bui-to-dwc/02-hello-world.md
- docs/01-gui-to-bui-to-dwc/03-gui-to-bui-to-dwc.md

Score against the 6-dimension rubric using the anchors defined in 04-RESEARCH.md. For each dimension, provide:
1. Score (1-5) with one-line key finding in the rubric table
2. Detailed prose analysis below the table explaining the score

For Completeness, explicitly evaluate BOTH lenses:
- Task lens: "Can a learner register, launch, and interact with a DWC app after reading this?"
- Topic lens: "Does this cover the GUI-to-BUI-to-DWC evolution adequately?"

For i18n Readiness, identify top 3 concrete issues (the RESEARCH already flagged "Going the Extra Mile" idiom in sec 02/03, and "Say Hello" button text in sec 03).

Include sections for:
- Content Gaps: bulleted list of what is missing, unclear, or outdated
- Recommendations: prescriptive for obvious wins, suggestive for judgment calls, include subtractive suggestions
- Mermaid Diagram Opportunities: RESEARCH recommends a sequence diagram (BBj server <-> JS bridge <-> browser event flow) to supplement the existing flowchart

Use the format from RESEARCH Pattern 1 (rubric table + prose + gaps + recommendations + Mermaid).

File exists at `.planning/phases/04-content-audit/chapters/ch01-audit.md`. Contains:
- Rubric table with all 6 dimensions scored 1-5
- "Overall: X.X / 5.0" line
- Completeness section mentioning both "task lens" and "topic lens"
- i18n section with at least 3 specific issues
- Content Gaps section with bulleted items
- Recommendations section with at least one subtractive recommendation
- Mermaid Diagram Opportunities section

  <done>Chapter 01 audit file is complete with rubric scores anchored to RESEARCH definitions, dual-lens completeness evaluation, concrete i18n issues, identified gaps, actionable recommendations (additive and subtractive), and Mermaid diagram suggestions.</done>

  <name>Task 2: Audit Chapter 02 - Browser Developer Tools & CSS</name>

Read all 5 files in Chapter 02:
- docs/02-browser-developer-tools/index.md
- docs/02-browser-developer-tools/01-intro-to-css.md
- docs/02-browser-developer-tools/02-developer-tools.md
- docs/02-browser-developer-tools/03-css-custom-properties.md
- docs/02-browser-developer-tools/04-dwc-themes.md

This is the LARGEST chapter (828 lines, 76 code blocks). Pay special attention to:
- Whether this chapter tries to do too much (RESEARCH flagged: "covers CSS fundamentals, developer tools, CSS custom properties, Shadow DOM, theming, and font compatibility. This may be trying to do too much.")
- Whether the CSS fundamentals section is at the right level for the audience (BBj developers may or may not know CSS)
- Code examples quality: with 76 code blocks, evaluate variety, annotation, and progressive complexity

Score against the 6-dimension rubric using the anchors defined in 04-RESEARCH.md. Follow the same format as Task 1.

For Mermaid recommendations, RESEARCH suggests a state diagram for style specificity cascade (inline > class > universal) and a class diagram for Shadow DOM component structure.

Flag subtractive opportunities -- at 828 lines, there may be sections that are overly verbose or could be linked to external CSS references rather than explained inline.

File exists at `.planning/phases/04-content-audit/chapters/ch02-audit.md`. Contains:
- Rubric table with all 6 dimensions scored 1-5
- "Overall: X.X / 5.0" line
- Specific commentary on whether the chapter scope is too broad
- Completeness section with both task and topic lenses
- i18n section with at least 3 specific issues
- Content Gaps section
- Recommendations section with subtractive recommendations (given 828-line size)
- Mermaid Diagram Opportunities section

  <done>Chapter 02 audit file is complete with rubric scores, scope analysis (too broad?), dual-lens completeness, i18n issues, gaps, recommendations with subtractive suggestions for the largest chapter, and Mermaid diagram suggestions.</done>

After both tasks complete:
1. Both audit files exist in `.planning/phases/04-content-audit/chapters/`
2. Scores are differentiated (not all 3s -- anti-pattern from RESEARCH Pitfall 1)
3. Both files follow the same format for consistency
4. Recommendations reference available tooling: Mermaid diagrams, code tabs, IdealImage, BBj code blocks
5. No recommendations require installing new plugins (flag as v2 scope if so)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- ch01-audit.md and ch02-audit.md exist with complete rubric evaluations
- Scores are anchored to RESEARCH definitions (not inflated or deflated)
- Both chapters have identified gaps and actionable recommendations
- Both chapters have Mermaid diagram opportunities identified
- i18n assessment is concrete (specific issues, not vague scores)
- At least one subtractive recommendation per chapter
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/04-content-audit/04-01-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
